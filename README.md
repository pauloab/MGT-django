# MGT-django
This is a basic CRUD operation system designed for administrate and manage
basic tasks.

## History
I used to do some paid homeworks and proyects for my parthers at univerity,
but sometimes I forget how much they have to pay me, or who owns me money,
by that reasson, I developed this simple django app, with the only propose 
of administrate it

## Do you wanna see it?
You can visit the site on 
[pythonanywhere](https://pauloab.pythonanywhere.com)

### Advise!
It was never thought as a public app or a serious project. In this case 
I didn't care much about security, anyway, it have basic sacurities like HTTPS, CSRF and 
some others, but if you find a potential risk or something like that, you can
tell me :)
